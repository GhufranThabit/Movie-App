Must Have:

-The main page should shows a list of movies posters with their titles.
-Each movie poster will be clickable so when the user click it then it will open a page with the movie details.
-There should be a button in the bottom of each page for the user to move between pages.
-The app needs to have loading/error handling for the interaction with the API.
-The app needs some user interaction such that you need to grab different data from the API. So you cannot just grab everything from the API and store it locally with one fetch.

Nice to Have:
-Nice logo
